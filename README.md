1. A wellness company would like to analyze the longitudinal data for each user who are interested in their weight management.

2. We wanted to leverage all the data together to deliver two things, improve the efficiency of the coaches in delivering the service and second, enable the users to experiment with behavior modifications in order to improve the outcomes of their efforts.

3. Analyze correlations and links between different factors and weight/steps.

We utilized DSX, Watson AI Tone Analysis, R Studio, Facebook Prophet, to create this data.
