2/12/13 0:40,": Have you heard about My Fit Foods that are at HEBs?  They have meals and snacks made up and ready to microwave and eat.  Great when you are in a rush or traveling.  They are pretty expensive and come in small, medium, and large portions.  I bought a few of the small meals and figured that if I like them, I can buy a large and make two meals out of it to save some money.  You can also email an order to them and they package it for pick up the next day.  No excuses to eat poorly!!!  There is also a website myfitmeals.com"
