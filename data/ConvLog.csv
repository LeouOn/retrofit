It causes burning pain on the top and bottom foot at the base of the toes.  Received an injection and am supposed to stay off my feet for a few days.  I have a wheelchair stored in the garage.  I'm going to take it out and use that at home to get my """"steps"""" in for the next few days."

500d776be4b056530e60afb6,7/23/12 16:10,Client,577,,"Yes, I have had this for several years.  I think it is related to when I broke that foot five years ago.  It has been under fairly good control that past year because I learned some exercises at PT that I now do at home.  I think it flared up after I went rowing a couple of weeks ago due to the strap that holds your foot in.  I have been rowing since and focused on not pulling my feet against the straps and did fine.  Do you have any suggestions for a good video for wheelchair exercises/aerobics?  I need to figure out some back up exercises I can do in these instances."

500dabb4e4b056530e60b170,7/23/12 19:53,Client,222,,"Yes, I have one from when I broke it.  I just have to limit being on my foot for a couple of days so I'll use it at home in the evenings so that I can stay mobile/active rather than sitting at the computer or TV all night."

This has historically been part of my problem.  I will push myself regarding my various orthopedic problems and than end up having to sit out longer - vicious cycle. I really have to work sometimes to tell myself that I need to stop doing something or not do something that particular day because I am feeling pain.

Today was my last day to be there since I will retiring soon.  Some of the people wanted to take me out of lunch.  Options were limited.  There are two restaurants in town and one was closed due to a death in the family.  The other restaurant had a buffet and I was told they would have fish since it was Friday.  When we got there, they had run out of fish and only had enchiladas left.  I took two cheese enchiladas, which didn't look too bad because they had a chili sauce on top, not a cheese sauce.  I passed on the beans and rice and had green beans and salad instead,When I got back to my office, the building was surround by police, fire rescue vehicles, etc.  I headed home to find out there had been a bomb threat!"

This means your weight change for any given week on the program is now measured from Monday to Sunday.We have adjusted your program start to the Monday prior to your first weigh-in.  If your first weigh-in was on a Monday, then it remains as-is. Due to this change you may see a change in the historical green-gray-red pattern you are used to seeing.  Rest assured, your data hasn't actually changed - just how it is parceled out to each individual week. If you have any questions, please contact your program advisor.We would like to tell you about two other enhancements we just released:First, we upgraded the graphs that display weight, activity and sleep data.  You can now click and drag to zoom in on a section of data.  In addition you can click on the legend of the graph to turn a particular data series on/off.Second, we added a new """"Quiz Results"""" tab where you can view the results of your Lifestyle Patterns Quiz in a nice, graphical format.Thanks - The Retrofit Development Team"

You have 25 weeks left and we want to make sure that we capture and recognize all the changes you have made for yourself. One great way to do this is by having you retake the Life Style Patterns Quiz. You took this in the beginning of the program. You can find the link to retake your lifestyle patterns quiz under your quiz results tab on your dashboard. In the upper left hand corner you should have the link that says retake quiz. Once completed you will be able to view and compare your past and present results. We should schedule a checkin call in the near future to go over your results."

Remember in difficult situations the goal is to ‰ÛÏmaintain‰Ûù, not to lose weight- focus on damage control2. Bounce back to routine when the difficult time passes3. Use walking and reading as alternative coping skills4. Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate (buy new clothing!)"

Wanted to check and see how you were doing and make sure you are drinking enough fluid!  Will you be trying any new foods anytime soon!  Love to see that variety!  Take care."
5111e261e4b056530e6ac2f9,2/6/13 4:56,Client,307,,Getting kind of discouraged because I seem to have reached a plateau.  My weight is swinging up and down pretty regularly sometimes over a pound at a time.  Could it be that I'm not getting enough fluids?  I'm working back more vigorous exercise slowly so as not to reinjure my rib.  So far it's doing okay.
5111e261e4b056530e6ac2f9,2/6/13 4:56,Client,876,,"I noticed your weight fluctuating too!  Definitely if you are not drinking enough...it can effect your weight/loss.  In addition if you have been taking any type of anti-inflammatories for your injuries...that can make you retain water.  I am glad that you are slowly building that activity back in.  Are you still tracking your calories on the Fitbit site?  I have seen you post your calories consumed...calories expended....if you are eating at the calories for your goal (160#)...looking back at my notes...we estimated that you should be around 1461 calories a day...365 calories for breakfast, lunch and dinner at 183 calories each... for 2 snacks.  I hope as you increase your activity and your fluid...your weight loss will increase, however it may be worth seeing if you can decrease your calories in....closer to the 1461 calories.  Let me know what I can do to help."

Would you be willing to go back and try eating like you were when you started?  If you need help with that, I can go back on the timeline and look up what you were eating.  I am wondering about the dried fruit that you have been eating....even though you are tracking the calories of them...it may be worth changing them out for some fresh fruit...less calories and more water content too!"
5111e261e4b056530e6ac2f9,2/6/13 4:56,Client,425,,"I can go back on the timeline and look, no need for you to do it.  I'll switch out the dried fruit, that's not a problem.  It was convenient because I could take it with me in a ziplock and not have to worry about purchasing a snack in a convenience store, but I'll find something else that's portable.  I stopped buying bananas a couple of weeks ago because they are higher in calories and went back to more berries instead."

I wanted to leave you with a couple of things to take with you for futures reference since I will not be continuing on to year 2 with you! Always remember Retrofit's fitness philosophy. It is the basic formula that will never steer you wrong! Remember that anything can be a workout.. Use your imagination!‰Û¢ Never skip more than 2 days of exercise in a row‰Û¢ Be active in and out of the gym by increasing activities of daily living (steps)‰Û¢ Something is ALWAYS better than nothing‰Û¢ Be efficient. Work out smarter not necessarily harder/longer‰Û¢ Choosing exercises you enjoy will increase the likelihood of compliance‰Û¢ Make exercise as convenient as possible‰Û¢ Track all exercise and review it weekly‰Û¢ Plan ahead and schedule all workouts‰Û¢ Be flexible with your exercise routine. Instead of skipping a workout because you‰Ûªre pressed for time, do an abbreviated version‰Û¢ Stay properly hydrated and fueled for workouts‰Û¢ Set short and long term exercise goalsGood luck with your future endeavors! It has been an absolute pleasure!"

They are writing a fitness article that would include first-person anecdotes on how the person incorporates gratitude and mindfulness into their workouts.For example, you may have a mantra that allows you appreciate the blessing of movement: perhaps you say a silent prayer for an ailing loved one with every mile you walk, or use positive affirmations.The writer would like to give readers the tools for turning a dreaded session into a mind-body booster that leaves her happier, more thankful, and more attuned to the wider world.The writer is with a magazine that has a target audience of women typically aged 25-50.If you would like to share your idea or know someone who does, please email me at gary@retrofitme.com.Regards,Lead Exercise Physiologist"

Thank to those of you who have shared your excitement, feedback, frustrations, thoughts and recommendations for what's working and what's not working in regards to our recent 2.0 upgrade.Second, we're listening! Our development team is already working to resolve some reported bugs that need the quickest attention. In fact, we released site updates on Monday, Wednesday and Sunday evenings this past week based on your feedback. The following items have been addressed:Added ability to log weight/steps in mobile web appFixed weight rounding (now show to one decimal place)Corrected various iOS 7 issuesCorrected various Android display issuesCorrected a few message display issues related to timezone calculationsFixed input boxes for food/exercise to automatically increase in size as neededMany of our newly released features came from the past 2 years of client learning and research on what you need to be most successful losing weight. We're purposely designing this system to be as customizable as we can because each of you need something a little different - as you've probably realized by now. I encourage you to talk to your team if something doesn't feel like it's working for you - many of the food logging features are customizable to ensure it fits into your life.And in case you're interested, here is some of the feedback we've documented and the development team is working through:Displaying start weight on timeline weight graphDisplaying daily weight and step data on timelineDisplaying weekly gains and losses (the old green-red-gray 'chiclets')Concern that food logging is more complex than it used to be and having pre-set times feels limitingWe're hard at work on these (and other) features and feedback that has come up so continue watching for the updates and make sure your personal team is aware of any feedback or improvements you have for us.Thank you for working with us to create an amazing Retrofit experience and so we can continue helping you be successful in accomplishing your weight loss goals.Best in Health,Whitney Durbinwhitney@retrofitme.com"
