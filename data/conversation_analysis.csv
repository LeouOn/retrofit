Options were limited.  There are two restaurants in town and one was closed due to a death in the family.  The other restaurant had a buffet and I was told they would have fish since it was Friday.  When we got there, they had run out of fish and only had enchiladas left.  I took two cheese enchiladas, which didn't look too bad because they had a chili sauce on top, not a cheese sauce.  I passed on the beans and rice and had green beans and salad instead,When I got back to my office, the building was surround by police, fire rescue vehicles, etc.  I headed home to find out there had been a bomb threat!"

This means your weight change for any given week on the program is now measured from Monday to Sunday.We have adjusted your program start to the Monday prior to your first weigh-in.  If your first weigh-in was on a Monday, then it remains as-is. Due to this change you may see a change in the historical green-gray-red pattern you are used to seeing.  Rest assured, your data hasn't actually changed - just how it is parceled out to each individual week. If you have any questions, please contact your program advisor.We would like to tell you about two other enhancements we just released:First, we upgraded the graphs that display weight, activity and sleep data.  You can now click and drag to zoom in on a section of data.  In addition you can click on the legend of the graph to turn a particular data series on/off.Second, we added a new """"Quiz Results"""" tab where you can view the results of your Lifestyle Patterns Quiz in a nice, graphical format.Thanks - The Retrofit Development Team"

You have 25 weeks left and we want to make sure that we capture and recognize all the changes you have made for yourself. One great way to do this is by having you retake the Life Style Patterns Quiz. You took this in the beginning of the program. You can find the link to retake your lifestyle patterns quiz under your quiz results tab on your dashboard. In the upper left hand corner you should have the link that says retake quiz. Once completed you will be able to view and compare your past and present results.

Even though our sessions have ended I am here to support you so please feel free to reach out via timeline or email.1. Remember in difficult situations the goal is to ���maintain���, not to lose weight- focus on damage control2. Bounce back to routine when the difficult time passes3. Use walking and reading as alternative coping skills4. Celebrate, celebrate, celebrate (buy new clothing!)"

I wanted to leave you with a couple of things to take with you for futures reference since I will not be continuing on to year 2 with you! Always remember Retrofit's fitness philosophy. It is the basic formula that will never steer you wrong! Remember that anything can be a workout.. Use your imagination!��� Never skip more than 2 days of exercise in a row��� Be active in and out of the gym by increasing activities of daily living (steps)��� Something is ALWAYS better than nothing��� Be efficient. Work out smarter not necessarily harder/longer��� Choosing exercises you enjoy will increase the likelihood of compliance��� Make exercise as convenient as possible��� Track all exercise and review it weekly��� Plan ahead and schedule all workouts��� Be flexible with your exercise routine. Instead of skipping a workout because you���re pressed for time, do an abbreviated version��� Stay properly hydrated and fueled for workouts��� Set short and long term exercise goalsGood luck with your future endeavors! It has been an absolute pleasure!"

Thank to those of you who have shared your excitement, feedback, frustrations, thoughts and recommendations for what's working and what's not working in regards to our recent 2.0 upgrade.Second, we're listening! Our development team is already working to resolve some reported bugs that need the quickest attention. In fact, we released site updates on Monday, Wednesday and Sunday evenings this past week based on your feedback. The following items have been addressed:Added ability to log weight/steps in mobile web appFixed weight rounding (now show to one decimal place)Corrected various iOS 7 issuesCorrected various Android display issuesCorrected a few message display issues related to timezone calculationsFixed input boxes for food/exercise to automatically increase in size as neededMany of our newly released features came from the past 2 years of client learning and research on what you need to be most successful losing weight. We're purposely designing this system to be as customizable as we can because each of you need something a little different - as you've probably realized by now. I encourage you to talk to your team if something doesn't feel like it's working for you - many of the food logging features are customizable to ensure it fits into your life.And in case you're interested, here is some of the feedback we've documented and the development team is working through:Displaying start weight on timeline weight graphDisplaying daily weight and step data on timelineDisplaying weekly gains and losses (the old green-red-gray 'chiclets')Concern that food logging is more complex than it used to be and having pre-set times feels limitingWe're hard at work on these (and other) features and feedback that has come up so continue watching for the updates and make sure your personal team is aware of any feedback or improvements you have for us.Thank you for working with us to create an amazing Retrofit experience and so we can continue helping you be successful in accomplishing your weight loss goals.Best in Health,Whitney Durbinwhitney@retrofitme.com"

Before leaving, map out some hotel options and check into see if they have pool and/or treadmill. 2..  Every 2-3 hours schedule stops to get out stretch your legs and get some steps in. 3.  Keep  higher calorie snacks out of your reach -  lock them in truck- take the time to think about eating it.  4..  Keep enough water in the car -   go back to mark on the bottle the time you opened the water to make sure you are monitoring water intake throughout the day.  Also, remember to bring along some things which keep your hands busy while in car!Wishing you a wonderful holiday, and ENJOY your trip!
